otherwise, this License or any of its rights under this License to any third
party without Licensor’s prior written consent, such consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.  The terms of this License will be binding
upon the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. 

7.2  Notices. To be effective, notices, consents, and approvals under this
License must be delivered in writing by electronic mail, courier, or certified
or registered mail, (postage prepaid and return receipt requested) to the other
party at the address for each party and will be effective upon receipt, except
that electronic mail may be used to distribute routine communications and to
obtain approvals and consents but may not be used for any other notices. Each
party may change its email address and/or address for receipt of notice by
giving notice of such change to the other party. 

7.3  Governing Law. This License will be governed by and interpreted in
accordance with the laws of the State of Colorado without reference to its
choice of law rules. If for any reason a dispute is of a nature that cannot be
resolved through the arbitration provision provided herein, the parties hereby
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and waive any venue objections against,
state or federal courts sitting in Denver, Colorado in any litigation arising
out of this License or the Services. The United Nations Convention on Contracts
for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this License. 

7.4 Remedies. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this License, the
parties’ rights and remedies under this License are cumulative. Each party
acknowledges and agrees that any actual or threatened breach of Sections 3.1, or
3.2 will constitute immediate, irreparable harm to the non-breaching party for
which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy, that injunctive relief is
an appropriate remedy for such breach, and that if granted, the breaching party
agrees to waive any bond that would otherwise be required. If any legal action
is brought by a party to enforce this License, the prevailing party will be
entitled to receive its attorneys’ fees, court costs, and other legal expenses,
in addition to any other relief it may receive from the non-prevailing party.

7.5  Compliance with Laws. Each party shall comply with those laws, rules, and
regulations in jurisdictions within the United States that are specifically
applicable to the applicable party. 

7.6  Waivers. To be effective, any waivers must be in writing and signed by the
party to be charged. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of this
License on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of
such provision on any other occasion.

7.7  Severability. If any provision of this License is, for any reason, held to
be unenforceable, the other provisions of this License will be unimpaired, and
the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is
valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law (unless such
modification is not permitted by law, in which case such provision will be
disregarded).

7.8  Entire License. This License constitutes the final and entire agreement
between the parties regarding the subject hereof and supersedes all other
agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties concerning such subject
matter. No amendment to this License will be effective unless in writing and
signed by the party to be charged.
