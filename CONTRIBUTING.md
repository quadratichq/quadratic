Thank you for considering contributing to the data science spreadsheet :sparkles:

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide, you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Getting started

Make sure you can run Quadratic locally from the source.

If you have any problems getting the project to run locally, please create an issue to document the problem. See "Create an issue" below.

### Issues for Feature Requests and Bugs

Quadratic uses GitHub issues to track all feature requests and bugs.

#### Create an issue

If you have a feature request or spot a problem, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue does not exist, please open a new issue!

When reporting a bug, please provide:

- Issue description
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- What's the expected result?
- What's the actual result?
- Additional details / screenshots

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/quadratichq/quadratic/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See [Labels](/contributing/how-to-use-labels.md) for more information.
