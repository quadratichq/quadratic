## How to test js.rs functions (Rust functions that call into TS)

Use `#[serial]` from `use serial_test::serial;` for the test function (this
ensures that the global static `TEST_ARRAY` is not changed by other functions).

Any time a jsFunction is called from js.rs, the function and its args are added
to the `lazy_static TEST_ARRAY` in js.rs. You can access the results of that via
two functions:

`expect_js_call(name: &str, args: String, clear: bool)` - asserts whether the
function with the `name` has the args (usually formatted as `format!("{},{}",
&arg1, &arg2)` -- but check the js.rs for the actual format). This removes that
call from the `TEST_ARRAY`. If `clear` = true then it also clears the entire
`TEST_ARRAY` (which is needed since we don't have 100% coverage on all js.rs
calls yet).`

`expect_js_call_count(name: &str, count: usize, clear: bool)` - asserts whether
the `name` function was called a specific number of times. If it matches it will
clear the `TEST_ARRAY` of those functions. If `clear` = true then it will also
clear the entire `TEST_ARRAY` (for the same reason as above).
