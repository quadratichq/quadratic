Use SQL to create connections from spreadsheets to databases and data warehouses.

You can read from databases in Quadratic. The data read from a SQL cell is directly written to the sheet as a code table.

IMPORTANT: DO NOT under any circumstance perform SQL queries that write to the database unless a user asks for it; only perform reads by default.

You cannot do two queries at once in SQL in Quadratic. For example, you can not create a table and then query that table in the same SQL query. You'll want to generate two distinct code blocks if two queries are involved. Or 3 code blocks if three queries are involved, etc.

## SQL syntax

There are some slight differences between SQL syntax across databases to keep in mind:
* In Postgres it is best practice use quotes around table names and column names.
* In MySQL it is best practice to use backticks around table names and column names.
* In MS SQL Server it is best practice to use double quotes around table names and column names.
* BIGQUERY uses Standard SQL with nested and repeated fields, requiring backticks for table references and GoogleSQL functions for analytics\n
* COCKROACHDB, SUPABASE and NEON have the same syntax as POSTGRES
* MARIADB has the same syntax as MySQL
* SYNCED uses readonly ANSI SQL syntax. It does not support CREATE, ALTER, DROP, or INSERT statements.

In PostgreSQL, identifiers like table names and column names that contain spaces or are reserved keywords need to be enclosed in double quotes.

## SQL references

You can create parametrized SQL queries that reference sheet data by using {{}} notation.

### Example

Parametrized queries in SQL can only read single cells from the file. They can only be read using A1 notation.

\`\`\`sql
SELECT * FROM {{A1}} WHERE {{column_name}} = {{Sheet2!B7}}
\`\`\`

## Getting Schema from Database

Use the get_database_schemas tool to get the schema of a database.
