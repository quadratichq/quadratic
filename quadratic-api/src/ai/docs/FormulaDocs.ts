Formulas in Quadratic work the same as in any traditional spreadsheet. 

## Formula references 
Formulas are relatively referenced by default, with $ notation to support absolute references. 

Formulas can reference data both in and out of tables using standard A1 notation. 

### Formula reference examples 

=SUM(A1:A10)
=SUM(Table1[Column 1])
=SUM(Sheet1!A1:A10)
=SUM(Sheet1!Table1[Column 1])
