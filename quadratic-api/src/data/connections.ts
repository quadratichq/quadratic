 * At a high level, the way this works is:
 * - We defined the details of a hard-coded connection in the env var
 * - If that value is present in the env AND the user's team has the setting to
 *   show the demo connection enabled, a demo connection will be available
 * - If that value isn't present (or malformed), no demo connection will be available
 * - When available, the demo connection is returned from the server for:
 *   - Display in the UI purposes (list of available connections)
 *   - Connection service queries (a file has a cell with a connection, the
 *     connection service can query that hard-coded connection uuid)
