Other spreadsheet software treats dates, times, and durations as pure numbers, which can cause mistakes and can't represent operations like "plus one month". Instead, Quadratic has separate types of data for each of the following:

- **Date**, such as `April 8, 2024`
- **Time**, such as `2:30 PM`
- **Date time**, such as `April 8, 2024 2:30 PM`
- **Duration**, such as `6 months 15 days 1h30m12s`

In formulas:

- Dates can be constructed using [`DATE()`](#date) (e.g., `DATE(2024, 4, 8)`)
- Times can be constructed using [`TIME()`](#time) (e.g., `TIME(14, 30, 0)`)
- Date times can be constructed by adding a date and a time (e.g., `DATE(2024, 4, 8) + TIME(14, 30, 0)`)
- Durations can be constructed using [`DURATION.YMD()`](#durationymd), [`DURATION.HMS()`](#durationhms), or by adding them both (e.g., `DURATION.YMD(0, 6, 15) + DURATION.HMS(1, 30, 12)`)

Dates, times, and date times can be entered into a cell using the formats above, or other formats (such as `YYYY-MM-DD`). Durations can be entered using long form (such as `1 hour, 30 minutes, 12 seconds`) or short form (such as `1h30m12s`). Durations support the following units:

- **Years**, written `y`, `yr`, `year`, `yrs`, or `years`
- **Months**, written `mo`, `mon`, `month`, or `months`
- **Weeks**, written `w`, `week`, or `weeks`
- **Days**, written `d`, `day`, or `days`
- **Hours**, written `h`, `hr`, `hour`, `hrs`, or `hours`
- **Minutes**, written `m`, `min`, `minute`, `mins`, or `minutes`
- **Seconds**, written `s`, `sec`, `second`, `secs`, or `seconds`
- **Milliseconds**, written `ms`, `millisec`, `millisecond`, or `milliseconds`
- **Microseconds**, written `us`, `Âµs`, `microsec`, `microsecond`, or `microseconds`
- **Nanoseconds**, written `ns`, `nanosec`, `nanosecond`, or `nanoseconds`
- **Picoseconds**, written `ps`, `picosec`, `picosecond`, or `picoseconds`
- **Femtoseconds**, written `fs`, `femtosec`, `femtosecond`, or `femtoseconds`
- **Attoseconds**, written `as`, `attosec`, `attosecond`, or `attoseconds`

Quadratic automatically converts between years and months (with 1 year = 12 months) and between any units less than one month, but does not convert months into days because months vary in length.

In formulas:

Durations can also be constructed by subtracting two times or two datetimes. Durations can be added to or subtracted from all of these types as well, including other durations.

For compatibility with other spreadsheets, subtracting two days gives a number of days. This can be converted to a duration using [`DURATION.YMD()`](#durationymd).
