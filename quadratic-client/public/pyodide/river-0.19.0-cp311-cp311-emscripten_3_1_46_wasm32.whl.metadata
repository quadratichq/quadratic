  River is a Python library for <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Online_machine_learning">online machine learning</a>. It aims to be the most user-friendly library for doing machine learning on streaming data. River is the result of a merger between <a href="https://github.com/MaxHalford/creme">creme</a> and <a href="https://github.com/scikit-multiflow/scikit-multiflow">scikit-multiflow</a>.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart

As a quick example, we'll train a logistic regression to classify the [website phishing dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Website+Phishing). Here's a look at the first observation in the dataset.

```python
>>> from pprint import pprint
>>> from river import datasets

>>> dataset = datasets.Phishing()

>>> for x, y in dataset:
...     pprint(x)
...     print(y)
...     break
{'age_of_domain': 1,
 'anchor_from_other_domain': 0.0,
 'empty_server_form_handler': 0.0,
 'https': 0.0,
 'ip_in_url': 1,
 'is_popular': 0.5,
 'long_url': 1.0,
 'popup_window': 0.0,
 'request_from_other_domain': 0.0}
True

```

Now let's run the model on the dataset in a streaming fashion. We sequentially interleave predictions and model updates. Meanwhile, we update a performance metric to see how well the model is doing.

```python
>>> from river import compose
>>> from river import linear_model
>>> from river import metrics
>>> from river import preprocessing

>>> model = compose.Pipeline(
...     preprocessing.StandardScaler(),
...     linear_model.LogisticRegression()
... )

>>> metric = metrics.Accuracy()

>>> for x, y in dataset:
...     y_pred = model.predict_one(x)      # make a prediction
...     metric = metric.update(y, y_pred)  # update the metric
...     model = model.learn_one(x, y)      # make the model learn

>>> metric
Accuracy: 89.28%

```

Of course, this is just a contrived example. We welcome you to check the [introduction](https://riverml.xyz/dev/introduction/installation/) section of the documentation for a more thorough tutorial.

## üõ† Installation

River is intended to work with **Python 3.8 and above**. Installation can be done with `pip`:

```sh
pip install river
```

There are [wheels available](https://pypi.org/project/river/#files) for Linux, MacOS, and Windows, which means that you most probably won't have to build River from source.

You can install the latest development version from GitHub as so:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/online-ml/river --upgrade
```

Or, through SSH:

```sh
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/online-ml/river.git --upgrade
```

## üîÆ Features

River provides online implementations of the following family of algorithms:

- Linear models, with a wide array of optimizers
- Decision trees and random forests
- (Approximate) nearest neighbors
- Anomaly detection
- Drift detection
- Recommender systems
- Time series forecasting
- Bandits
- Factorization machines
- Imbalanced learning
- Clustering
- Bagging/boosting/stacking
- Active learning

River also provides other online utilities:

- Feature extraction and selection
- Online statistics and metrics
- Preprocessing
- Built-in datasets
- Progressive model validation
- Model pipelines

## ü§î Should I be using River?

You should ask yourself if you need online machine learning. The answer is likely no. Most of the time batch learning does the job just fine. An online approach might fit the bill if:

- You want a model that can learn from new data without having to revisit past data.
- You want a model which is robust to [concept drift](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Concept_drift).
- You want to develop your model in a way that is closer to what occurs in a production context, which is usually event-based.

Some specificities of River are that:

- It focuses on clarity and user experience, more so than performance.
- It's very fast at processing one sample at a time. Try it, you'll see.
- It plays nicely with the rest of Python's ecosystem.
