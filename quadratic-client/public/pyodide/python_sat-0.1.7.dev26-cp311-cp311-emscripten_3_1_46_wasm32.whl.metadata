A Python library providing a simple interface to a number of state-of-art
Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers and a few types of cardinality and
pseudo-Boolean encodings. The purpose of PySAT is to enable researchers
working on SAT and its applications and generalizations to easily prototype
with SAT oracles in Python while exploiting incrementally the power of the
original low-level implementations of modern SAT solvers.

With PySAT it should be easy for you to implement a MaxSAT solver, an
MUS/MCS extractor/enumerator, or any tool solving an application problem
with the (potentially multiple) use of a SAT oracle.
