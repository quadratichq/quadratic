=======================================
cbor-diag: Diagnostic notation for CBOR
=======================================

This Python module is a minimal wapper around the `cbor-diag crate`_.
Unlike the crate,
which offers lots of functionality for manipulating an AST,
this module only exposes two very simple functions:

* ``diag2cbor``, which parses diagnostic notation and produces a corresponding CBOR binary string, and
* ``cbor2diag``, which does the inverse.

It is recommended to use the cbor2_ package to actually process the CBOR data.

Documentation is available `on readthedocs`_.

Installation
============

This project can be installed `from PyPI`_;
binary wheels are available there for the common platforms.

Maintenance
===========

This package is considered feature-complete at release,
and maintainened reactively --
when changes to the ecosystem threaten to make it unusable.

New features are only expected to be added
if they are already present in the underlying `cbor-diag crate`_,
and will likely manifest as extra arguments to ``cbor2diag``.

This package is built using maturin_ and pyo3_
and largely follows their template.
The built module is renamed from ``cbor_diag`` to ``_cbor_diag``
(and consequently wrapped manually)
to avoid it being part of the package's public API.

The package is currently hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/chrysn/cbor-diag-py
because maturin can `not yet`_ build pipelines for GitLab or codeberg.
