    <b>Galactic Dynamics in python</b>
</p>

[galpy](http://www.galpy.org) is a Python package for galactic dynamics. It supports orbit integration in a variety of potentials, evaluating and sampling various distribution functions, and the calculation of action-angle coordinates for all static potentials. `galpy` is an [astropy](http://www.astropy.org/) [affiliated package](http://www.astropy.org/affiliated/) and provides full support for astropyâ€™s [Quantity](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.units.Quantity.html) framework for variables with units.

LOOKING FOR HELP?
=================

The latest documentation can be found
[here](http://docs.galpy.org/en/latest/). You can also join the
[galpy slack community](https://galpy.slack.com/) for any questions
related to `galpy`; join
[here](https://join.slack.com/t/galpy/shared_invite/zt-p6upr4si-mX7u8MRdtm~3bW7o8NA_Ww).

If you find *any* bug in the code, please report these using the [Issue
Tracker](http://github.com/jobovy/galpy/issues) or by joining the [galpy
slack community](https://galpy.slack.com/).

If you are having issues with the installation of `galpy`, please first
consult the [Installation
FAQ](http://docs.galpy.org/en/latest/installation.html#installation-faq).

PYTHON VERSIONS AND DEPENDENCIES
================================

`galpy` supports Python 3. Specifically, galpy supports Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10,
and 3.11. GitHub Actions CI builds regularly check support for
Python 3.10 (and of 3.8, and 3.9 using a more limited, core set of tests)
on Linux and Windows (and 3.10 on Mac OS). Python 2.7 is no longer supported.

This package requires [Numpy](https://numpy.org/),
[Scipy](http://www.scipy.org/), and
[Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/). Certain advanced
features require the GNU Scientific Library
([GSL](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)), with action calculations
requiring version 1.14 or higher. Other optional dependencies include:

* Support for providing inputs and getting outputs as Quantities with units is provided through
[`astropy`](http://www.astropy.org/).
* Querying SIMBAD for the coordinates of an object in the `Orbit.from_name` initialization method requires [`astroquery`](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
* Displaying a progress bar for certain operations (e.g., orbit integration of multiple objects at once) requires [`tqdm`](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm).
* Plotting arbitrary functions of Orbit attributes requires [`numexpr`](https://github.com/pydata/numexpr).
* Speeding up the evaluation of certain functions in the C code requires [`numba`](https://numba.pydata.org/).
* Constant-anisotropy DFs in `galpy.df.constantbetadf` require [`JAX`](https://github.com/google/jax).
* Use of `SnapshotRZPotential` and `InterpSnapshotRZPotential` requires [`pynbody`](https://github.com/pynbody/pynbody).

Other parts of the code may require additional packages and you will be alerted by the code if they are
not installed.

CONTRIBUTING TO GALPY
=====================

If you are interested in contributing to galpy\'s development, take a
look at [this brief
guide](https://github.com/jobovy/galpy/wiki/Guide-for-new-contributors)
on the wiki. This will hopefully help you get started!

Some further development notes can be found on the
[wiki](http://github.com/jobovy/galpy/wiki/). This includes a list of
small and larger extensions of galpy that would be useful
[here](http://github.com/jobovy/galpy/wiki/Possible-galpy-extensions) as
well as a longer-term roadmap
[here](http://github.com/jobovy/galpy/wiki/Roadmap). Please let the main
developer know if you need any help contributing!
