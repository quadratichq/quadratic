// When a user lands on `/` we don't necessarily know what team they're trying
// to access, so these functions manage that lifecycle.
//
// When a user successfully loads/accesses a team, we save that team's
// uuid in localstorage. Then if/when the user hits the `/` route again, that's
// the team we send them to.
//
// On the dashboard the `/` route will redirect to `/teams/:uuid`, so all links
// in that context will be prefixed with the team being linked to.
// However, this does mean that the following could happen:
//
//   1. TAB1: User goes to `/`
//   2. TAB1: They are redirected to `/teams/foo`
//   3. TAB2: User goes to `/`
//   4. TAB2: They are redirected to `/teams/foo`
//   5. TAB2: User switches team to team `bar`
//   6. TAB1: User goes to URL and types `/`
//   7. TAB1: They will be redirected to `/teams/bar` (not `foo` which they were just looking at
//
// This is a bit of an edge case, but it's good to be aware of how this works.
