Note: This is an internal message for context. Do not quote it in your response.\n\n
I have an open sheet, with sheet name '${currentSheetName}', all actions are performed on this sheet, unless the user specifies otherwise.\n
You can reference data from this or other sheets in the currently open file.\n

The current sheet has the following ranges:\n
${
  sheetBounds.type === 'nonEmpty'
    ? `- Data range: ${rectToA1(sheetBounds)}\n
- Note: This range may contain empty cells.\n`
    : '- The currently open sheet is empty.'
}\n
${
  formatBounds.type === 'nonEmpty'
    ? `- Formatting range (like bold, currency, etc.): ${rectToA1(formatBounds)}\n
- Note: This range may contain non-formatted cells.\n`
    : '- The currently open sheet does not have any formatting.'
}

You may use the get_cell_data function to retrieve information about the sheet that is not contained within the context.\n
Always ensure you have sufficient data before taking action on the sheet. Use get_cell_data to retrieve additional data as needed.\n
Note, there is no data outside the bounds provided above.\n

${
  !!currentSheetContext[0].tables_summary && currentSheetContext[0].tables_summary.length > 0

I am sharing tables summary in the currently open sheet as an array of table summary objects, each table summary object has following properties:\n
- sheet_name: This is the name of the sheet.\n
- table_name: This is the name of the table. You can use this name to reference the table in code.\n
- table_type: This denotes whether the table is an editable data table or a read only code table (code output).\n
- bounds: This is the bounds (top left cell and bottom right cell, both inclusive) of the data table in A1 notation, this includes the table name and column headers if they are visible.\n

There are following tables in the currently open sheet:\n
\`\`\`json
${JSON.stringify(currentSheetContext[0].tables_summary)}
\`\`\`
`
    : ''
}

Use the get_cell_data function to get additional data about the tables.

${
  !!currentSheetContext[0].charts_summary && currentSheetContext[0].charts_summary.length > 0
    ? `
I am sharing charts summary in the currently open sheet as an array of chart summary objects, each chart summary object has following properties:\n
- sheet_name: This is the name of the sheet.\n
- chart_name: This is the name of the chart.\n
- bounds: This is the bounds (top left cell and bottom right cell, both inclusive) of the chart in A1 notation, this includes the chart name.\n

Take into account chart bounds when adding values, code or charts to the sheet. Always avoid overplay with chart bounds.\n

There are following charts in the currently open sheet:\n
\`\`\`json
${JSON.stringify(currentSheetContext[0].charts_summary)}
\`\`\`
`

${
  !!currentSheetContext[0].data_rects && currentSheetContext[0].data_rects.length > 0
    ? `
I am sharing data in the currently open sheet as an array of tabular data rectangles, each tabular data rectangle in this array has following properties:\n
- sheet_name: This is the name of the sheet.\n
- rect_origin: This is the position of the top left cell of the data rectangle in A1 notation. Columns are represented by letters and rows are represented by numbers.\n
- rect_width: This is the width of the rectangle in number of columns.\n
- rect_height: This is the height of the rectangle in number of rows.\n
- starting_rect_values: This is a 2D array of cell values (json object format described below). This 2D array contains the starting 3 rows of data in the rectangle. This includes headers, if present, and data.\n

Each cell value is a JSON object having the following properties:\n
- value: The value of the cell. This is a string representation of the value in the cell.\n
- kind: The kind of the value. This can be blank, text, number, logical, time instant, duration, error, html, code, image, date, time, date time, null or undefined.\n
- pos: This is the position of the cell in A1 notation. Columns are represented by letters and rows are represented by numbers.\n\n

WARNING: This is ONLY a subset of the data. Use the get_cell_data function to get additional data as defined by the bounds.\n\n

There are following data in the currently open sheet:\n
\`\`\`json
${JSON.stringify(currentSheetContext[0].data_rects)}
\`\`\`
`
    : ''
}

Use the get_cell_data function to get additional data about the tables.

To work with more of the sheet's data, use the get_cell_data function in the following ways:\n
1. In formulas, use A1 notation directly: \`=SUM(A1:B2)\`\n
2. In Python and JavaScript, use \`q.cells("A1:B2")\`\n
3. For different sheets, include the sheet name: \`=SUM('Sheet 1'!A1:B2)\` or \`q.cells("'Sheet 1'!A1:B2")\`\n
4. For tables:\n
   - \`q.cells("Table_Name")\` for the entire table\n
   - \`q.cells("Table_Name[#ALL]")\` for table with headers (Formulas/JavaScript only)\n
   - \`q.cells("Table_Name[#HEADERS]")\` for table headers\n
   - \`q.cells("Table_Name[#DATA]")\` for table data (Formulas/JavaScript only)\n\n`
