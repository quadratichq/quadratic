I have following other sheets in the same file having the following data:

Data in the currently open file in other sheets:\n

I am sharing other sheets data as an array of tabular data rectangles, each tabular data rectangle in this array has following properties:\n
- sheet_name: This is the name of the sheet.\n
- rect_origin: This is the position of the top left cell of the data rectangle in A1 notation. Columns are represented by letters and rows are represented by numbers.\n
- rect_width: This is the width of the rectangle in number of columns.\n
- rect_height: This is the height of the rectangle in number of rows.\n
- starting_rect_values: This is a 2D array of cell values (json object format described below). This 2D array contains the starting 3 rows of data in the rectangle. This includes headers, if present, and data.\n

Each cell value is a JSON object having the following properties:\n
- value: The value of the cell. This is a string representation of the value in the cell.\n
- kind: The kind of the value. This can be blank, text, number, logical, time instant, duration, error, html, code, image, date, time, date time, null or undefined.\n
- pos: This is the position of the cell in A1 notation. Columns are represented by letters and rows are represented by numbers.\n\n

This is being shared so that you can understand the table format, size and value types inside the data rectangle.\n

Data from cells can be referenced by Formulas, Python, Javascript or SQL code.
In formula, cell reference are done using A1 notation directly, without quotes. Example: \`=SUM(A1:B2)\`. Always use sheet name in a1 notation to reference cells from different sheets. Sheet name is always enclosed in single quotes. Example: \`=SUM('Sheet 1'!A1:B2)\`.\n
In Python and Javascript use the cell reference function \`q.cells\`, i.e. \`q.cells(a1_notation_selection_string)\`, to reference data cells. Always use sheet name in a1 notation to reference cells from different sheets. Sheet name is always enclosed in single quotes. In Python and Javascript, the complete a1 notation selection string is enclosed in double quotes. Example: \`q.cells("'Sheet 1'!A1:B2")\`.
Sheet name is optional, if not provided, it is assumed to be the currently open sheet.\n
Sheet name is case sensitive, and is required to be enclosed in single quotes.\n
To reference data from different tabular data rectangles, use multiple \`q.cells\` functions.\n
Use this sheet data in the context of following messages. Refer to cells if required in code.\n\n

${sheetsRectContext.map((sheetRectContext) => {
  if (sheetRectContext.length === 0) return '';
  return `
Data in sheet '${sheetRectContext[0].sheet_name}':

\`\`\`json
${JSON.stringify(sheetRectContext)}
\`\`\`
`;
})}

Note: All this data is only for your reference to data on the sheet. This data cannot be used directly in code. Use the cell reference function \`q.cells\`, i.e. \`q.cells(a1_notation_selection_string)\`, to reference data cells in code. Always use sheet name in a1 notation to reference cells. Sheet name is always enclosed in single quotes. In Python and Javascript, the complete a1 notation selection string is enclosed in double quotes. Example: \`q.cells("'Sheet 1'!A1:B2")\`. In formula, string quotes are not to be used. Example: \`=SUM('Sheet 1'!A1:B2)\`\n\n
