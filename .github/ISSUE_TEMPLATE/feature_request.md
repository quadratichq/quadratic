## (Optional) Basic description/background
Include any basic details that aren't self explanatory in the issue title. Optionally include background on why this feature is necessary (user comments, research, etc).

## (Optional) Discussion items
Items that the person scoping the issue is unclear on that requires discussion. E.g. "I think abc and xyz should be included, but maybe only abc should be?"

## Wireframing, in-depth details, docs, etc.
Include here an in-depth description of how the feature should work. This can also be a link to some place else that has the description.

A good feature request should ideally include: 
- Clear and concise descriptions of how the feature should work 
- Wireframing for every UI element added 
- Best effort description of how features should interact, edge cases, etc.
