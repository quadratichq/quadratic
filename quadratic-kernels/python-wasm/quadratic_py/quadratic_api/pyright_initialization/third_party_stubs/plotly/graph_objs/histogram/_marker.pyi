        The 'colorbar' property is an instance of ColorBar
        that may be specified as:
          - An instance of :class:`plotly.graph_objs.histogram.marker.ColorBar`
          - A dict of string/value properties that will be passed
            to the ColorBar constructor

            Supported dict properties:

                bgcolor
                    Sets the color of padded area.
                bordercolor
                    Sets the axis line color.
                borderwidth
                    Sets the width (in px) or the border enclosing
                    this color bar.
                dtick
                    Sets the step in-between ticks on this axis.
                    Use with `tick0`. Must be a positive number, or
                    special strings available to "log" and "date"
                    axes. If the axis `type` is "log", then ticks
                    are set every 10^(n*dtick) where n is the tick
                    number. For example, to set a tick mark at 1,
                    10, 100, 1000, ... set dtick to 1. To set tick
                    marks at 1, 100, 10000, ... set dtick to 2. To
                    set tick marks at 1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ...
                    set dtick to log_10(5), or 0.69897000433. "log"
                    has several special values; "L<f>", where `f`
                    is a positive number, gives ticks linearly
                    spaced in value (but not position). For example
                    `tick0` = 0.1, `dtick` = "L0.5" will put ticks
                    at 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6 etc. To show powers of 10
                    plus small digits between, use "D1" (all
                    digits) or "D2" (only 2 and 5). `tick0` is
                    ignored for "D1" and "D2". If the axis `type`
                    is "date", then you must convert the time to
                    milliseconds. For example, to set the interval
                    between ticks to one day, set `dtick` to
                    86400000.0. "date" also has special values
                    "M<n>" gives ticks spaced by a number of
                    months. `n` must be a positive integer. To set
                    ticks on the 15th of every third month, set
                    `tick0` to "2000-01-15" and `dtick` to "M3". To
                    set ticks every 4 years, set `dtick` to "M48"
                exponentformat
                    Determines a formatting rule for the tick
                    exponents. For example, consider the number
                    1,000,000,000. If "none", it appears as
                    1,000,000,000. If "e", 1e+9. If "E", 1E+9. If
                    "power", 1x10^9 (with 9 in a super script). If
                    "SI", 1G. If "B", 1B.
                labelalias
                    Replacement text for specific tick or hover
                    labels. For example using {US: 'USA', CA:
                    'Canada'} changes US to USA and CA to Canada.
                    The labels we would have shown must match the
                    keys exactly, after adding any tickprefix or
                    ticksuffix. For negative numbers the minus sign
                    symbol used (U+2212) is wider than the regular
                    ascii dash. That means you need to use −1
                    instead of -1. labelalias can be used with any
                    axis type, and both keys (if needed) and values
                    (if desired) can include html-like tags or
                    MathJax.
                len
                    Sets the length of the color bar This measure
                    excludes the padding of both ends. That is, the
                    color bar length is this length minus the
                    padding on both ends.
                lenmode
                    Determines whether this color bar's length
                    (i.e. the measure in the color variation
                    direction) is set in units of plot "fraction"
                    or in *pixels. Use `len` to set the value.
                minexponent
                    Hide SI prefix for 10^n if |n| is below this
                    number. This only has an effect when
                    `tickformat` is "SI" or "B".
                nticks
                    Specifies the maximum number of ticks for the
                    particular axis. The actual number of ticks
                    will be chosen automatically to be less than or
                    equal to `nticks`. Has an effect only if
                    `tickmode` is set to "auto".
                orientation
                    Sets the orientation of the colorbar.
                outlinecolor
                    Sets the axis line color.
                outlinewidth
                    Sets the width (in px) of the axis line.
                separatethousands
                    If "true", even 4-digit integers are separated
                showexponent
                    If "all", all exponents are shown besides their
                    significands. If "first", only the exponent of
                    the first tick is shown. If "last", only the
                    exponent of the last tick is shown. If "none",
                    no exponents appear.
                showticklabels
                    Determines whether or not the tick labels are
                    drawn.
                showtickprefix
                    If "all", all tick labels are displayed with a
                    prefix. If "first", only the first tick is
                    displayed with a prefix. If "last", only the
                    last tick is displayed with a suffix. If
                    "none", tick prefixes are hidden.
                showticksuffix
                    Same as `showtickprefix` but for tick suffixes.
                thickness
                    Sets the thickness of the color bar This
                    measure excludes the size of the padding, ticks
                    and labels.
                thicknessmode
                    Determines whether this color bar's thickness
                    (i.e. the measure in the constant color
                    direction) is set in units of plot "fraction"
                    or in "pixels". Use `thickness` to set the
                    value.
                tick0
                    Sets the placement of the first tick on this
                    axis. Use with `dtick`. If the axis `type` is
                    "log", then you must take the log of your
                    starting tick (e.g. to set the starting tick to
                    100, set the `tick0` to 2) except when
                    `dtick`=*L<f>* (see `dtick` for more info). If
                    the axis `type` is "date", it should be a date
                    string, like date data. If the axis `type` is
                    "category", it should be a number, using the
                    scale where each category is assigned a serial
                    number from zero in the order it appears.
                tickangle
                    Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect
                    to the horizontal. For example, a `tickangle`
                    of -90 draws the tick labels vertically.
                tickcolor
                    Sets the tick color.
                tickfont
                    Sets the color bar's tick label font
                tickformat
                    Sets the tick label formatting rule using d3
                    formatting mini-languages which are very
                    similar to those in Python. For numbers, see: h

                    the year as a decimal number as well as "%{n}f"
                    for fractional seconds with n digits. For
                    example, *2016-10-13 09:15:23.456* with
                    tickformat "%H~%M~%S.%2f" would display

                    When used in a template (as layout.template.dat
                    a.histogram.marker.colorbar.tickformatstopdefau
                    lts), sets the default property values to use

                    histogram.marker.colorbar.tickformatstops
                ticklabeloverflow
                    Determines how we handle tick labels that would
                    overflow either the graph div or the domain of
                    the axis. The default value for inside tick
                    labels is *hide past domain*. In other cases
                    the default is *hide past div*.
                ticklabelposition
                    Determines where tick labels are drawn relative
                    to the ticks. Left and right options are used
                    when `orientation` is "h", top and bottom when
                    `orientation` is "v".
                ticklabelstep
                    Sets the spacing between tick labels as
                    compared to the spacing between ticks. A value
                    of 1 (default) means each tick gets a label. A
                    value of 2 means shows every 2nd label. A
                    larger value n means only every nth tick is
                    labeled. `tick0` determines which labels are
                    shown. Not implemented for axes with `type`
                    "log" or "multicategory", or when `tickmode` is
                    "array".
                ticklen
                    Sets the tick length (in px).
                tickmode
                    Sets the tick mode for this axis. If "auto",
                    the number of ticks is set via `nticks`. If
                    "linear", the placement of the ticks is
                    determined by a starting position `tick0` and a
                    tick step `dtick` ("linear" is the default
                    value if `tick0` and `dtick` are provided). If
                    "array", the placement of the ticks is set via
                    `tickvals` and the tick text is `ticktext`.
                    ("array" is the default value if `tickvals` is
                    provided).
                tickprefix
                    Sets a tick label prefix.
                ticks
                    Determines whether ticks are drawn or not. If
                    "", this axis' ticks are not drawn. If
                    "outside" ("inside"), this axis' are drawn
                    outside (inside) the axis lines.
                ticksuffix
                    Sets a tick label suffix.
                ticktext
                    Sets the text displayed at the ticks position
                    via `tickvals`. Only has an effect if
                    `tickmode` is set to "array". Used with
                    `tickvals`.

                    Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud
                    for `ticktext`.
                tickvals
                    Sets the values at which ticks on this axis
                    appear. Only has an effect if `tickmode` is set
                    to "array". Used with `ticktext`.

                reversescale
                    Reverses the color mapping if true. Has an
                    effect only if in `marker.line.color` is set to
                    a numerical array. If true, `marker.line.cmin`
                    will correspond to the last color in the array
                    and `marker.line.cmax` will correspond to the
                    first color.
                width
                    Sets the width (in px) of the lines bounding

        Parameters
        ----------
        arg
            dict of properties compatible with this constructor or
            an instance of
            :class:`plotly.graph_objs.histogram.Marker`
        autocolorscale
            Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
            (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
            `marker.colorscale`. Has an effect only if in
            `marker.color` is set to a numerical array. In case
            `colorscale` is unspecified or `autocolorscale` is
            true, the default palette will be chosen according to
            whether numbers in the `color` array are all positive,
            all negative or mixed.
        cauto
            Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
            with respect to the input data (here in `marker.color`)
            or the bounds set in `marker.cmin` and `marker.cmax`
            Has an effect only if in `marker.color` is set to a
            numerical array. Defaults to `false` when `marker.cmin`
            and `marker.cmax` are set by the user.
        cmax
            Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Has an effect
            only if in `marker.color` is set to a numerical array.
            Value should have the same units as in `marker.color`
            and if set, `marker.cmin` must be set as well.
        cmid
            Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling
            `marker.cmin` and/or `marker.cmax` to be equidistant to
            this point. Has an effect only if in `marker.color` is
            set to a numerical array. Value should have the same
            units as in `marker.color`. Has no effect when
            `marker.cauto` is `false`.
        cmin
            Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Has an effect
            only if in `marker.color` is set to a numerical array.
            Value should have the same units as in `marker.color`
            and if set, `marker.cmax` must be set as well.
        color
            Sets the marker color. It accepts either a specific
            color or an array of numbers that are mapped to the
            colorscale relative to the max and min values of the
            array or relative to `marker.cmin` and `marker.cmax` if
            set.
        coloraxis
            Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to
            these shared color axes are "coloraxis", "coloraxis2",
            "coloraxis3", etc. Settings for these shared color axes
            are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,
            `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color
            scales can be linked to the same color axis.
        colorbar
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.marker.ColorBar`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        colorscale
            Sets the colorscale. Has an effect only if in
            `marker.color` is set to a numerical array. The
            colorscale must be an array containing arrays mapping a
            normalized value to an rgb, rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or
            named color string. At minimum, a mapping for the
            lowest (0) and highest (1) values are required. For
            example, `[[0, 'rgb(0,0,255)'], [1, 'rgb(255,0,0)']]`.
            To control the bounds of the colorscale in color space,
            use `marker.cmin` and `marker.cmax`. Alternatively,
            `colorscale` may be a palette name string of the
            following list: Blackbody,Bluered,Blues,Cividis,Earth,E
            lectric,Greens,Greys,Hot,Jet,Picnic,Portland,Rainbow,Rd
            Bu,Reds,Viridis,YlGnBu,YlOrRd.
        colorsrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `color`.
        cornerradius
            Sets the rounding of corners. May be an integer number
            of pixels, or a percentage of bar width (as a string
            ending in %). Defaults to `layout.barcornerradius`. In
            stack or relative barmode, the first trace to set
            cornerradius is used for the whole stack.
        line
            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.histogram.marker.Line`
            instance or dict with compatible properties
        opacity
            Sets the opacity of the bars.
        opacitysrc
            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for
            `opacity`.
        pattern
            Sets the pattern within the marker.
        reversescale
            Reverses the color mapping if true. Has an effect only
            if in `marker.color` is set to a numerical array. If
            true, `marker.cmin` will correspond to the last color
            in the array and `marker.cmax` will correspond to the
            first color.
        showscale
            Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
            this trace. Has an effect only if in `marker.color` is
            set to a numerical array.
