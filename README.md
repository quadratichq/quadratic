# What is Quadratic?

Quadratic is a web-based spreadsheet application for technical users.

Our goal is to build a spreadsheet that enables you to pull your data from its source (SaaS, database, CSV, API, etc) and then work with that data using any popular programming language (Python, SQL, JS, Formulas, etc).

## What can I do with Quadratic?

- Build dashboards
