# Cursor Rules for Quadratic Project (team)

## General Code Style
- **Code Comments** When writing code comments, don't add change-specific comments, only comments that will help future devs understand the purpose of the code. For example, don't include "Improved performance of this loop by removing the second iteration", as it's not useful for future developers.

## Rust Code Style

- **Imports**: Always prefer importing types at the top of the file using `use` statements instead of using `crate::...` paths within function calls (unless absolutely necessary). Don't use super more than once, so super::super should be refactored.
  - Example: Use `use crate::{CellValue, Pos, SheetPos};` at the top, then use `Pos { x, y }` instead of `crate::Pos { x, y }` in the code.
  - This makes dependencies explicit and keeps the code cleaner.
- **Tests**:
  - Do not write tests that pass but should fail. If a test should fail, it should stay failing until it is properly fixed.
  - If you are running more than 10 tests in quadratic-core, then run the entire test suite, as the speed difference in negligible.
- **Compiling**: Unless specifically requested, don't compile code for purposes of running the app. That is handled by `node dev`, which has watchers.

## React Code Style

- **Components** when adding React components, create a new file unless they are very small
