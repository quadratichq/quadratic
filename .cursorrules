Preserve Smart Quotes

When editing UI text copy, preserve typographically correct “smart quotes” (a.k.a. curly quotes).

Reference: https://smartquotesforsmartpeople.com

- Double quotes: `“` and `”` (U+201C and U+201D)
- Single quotes: `‘` and `’` (U+2018 and U+2019)

Do **not** replace these with straight/dumb quotes (`"` and `'`) unless:

1. Explicitly asked to do so
2. The context requires ASCII-only characters (e.g., code syntax, JSON keys, shell commands, etc.)

Smart quotes are intentional and improve readability in prose, UI text, and documentation.
