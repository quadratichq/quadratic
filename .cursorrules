# Cursor Rules for Quadratic Project

## Rust Code Style

- **Imports**: Always prefer importing types at the top of the file using `use` statements instead of using `crate::...` paths within function calls (unless absolutely necessary). Don't use super more than once, so super::super should be refactored.
  - Example: Use `use crate::{CellValue, Pos, SheetPos};` at the top, then use `Pos { x, y }` instead of `crate::Pos { x, y }` in the code.
  - This makes dependencies explicit and keeps the code cleaner.
- **Tests**: Do not write tests that pass but should fail. If a test should fail, it should stay failing until it is properly fixed.
- **Compling**: Unless specifically requested, don't compile code for purposes of running the app. That is handled by `node dev`, which has watchers.
