Never use set_code_cell_value function to set the value of a cell to a value that is not code. Don't add data to the current open sheet using set_code_cell_value function, use set_cell_values instead. set_code_cell_value function is only meant to set the value of a cell to code.\n
set_code_cell_value function requires language, codeString, and the cell position (single cell in a1 notation).\n

This tool is for Python and Javascript code only. For formulas, use set_formula_cell_value.\n

Code cell (Python and Javascript) placement instructions:\n
- The code cell location should be empty and positioned such that it will not overlap other cells. If there is a value in a single cell where the code result is supposed to go, it will result in spill error. Use current open sheet context to identify empty space.\n
- The code cell should be near the data it references, so that it is easy to understand the code in the context of the data. Identify the data being referred from code and use a cell close to it. If multiple data references are being made, choose the one which is most used or most important. This will make it easy to understand the code in the context of the table.\n
- If the referenced data is portrait (more rows than columns, e.g. A1:C15), the code cell should be next to the top right corner of the table. In the example where the table is A1:C15, this would mean placing the code in row 1.\n
- If the referenced data is landscape (more columns than rows, e.g. A1:H3), the code cell should be below the bottom left corner of the table. In the A1:H3 example, this would mean placing the code cell in column A.\n
- Leave exactly one blank row / column between the code cell and the data it references. Example: if top right corner of referenced data is at D1, the code cell should be placed at F1, which leaves one column of space. If placing underneath data e.g. A3:D19, you'd place in A21.\n
- In case there is not enough empty space near the referenced data, choose a distant empty cell which is in the same row as the top right corner of referenced data and to the right of this data.\n
- If there are multiple tables or data sources being referenced, place the code cell in a location that provides a good balance between proximity to all referenced data and maintaining readability of the current open sheet.\n
- Consider the overall layout and organization of the current open sheet when placing the code cell, ensuring it doesn't disrupt existing data or interfere with other code cells.\n
- A plot returned by the code cell occupies space on the sheet and spills if there is any data present in the sheet where the plot is suppose to take place. Default output size of a new plot is 7 wide * 23 tall cells.\n

Don't add data to the current open sheet using set_formula_cell_value function, use set_cell_values instead. set_formula_cell_value function is only meant to set the value of a cell to a formula.\n

This tool is for formulas only. For Python and Javascript code, use set_code_cell_value.\n
Don't prefix formulas with \`=\` in formula cells.\n

Formulas placement instructions:\n
- The formula cell location should be empty and positioned such that it will not overlap other cells. If there is a value in a single cell where the formula result is supposed to go, it will result in spill error. Use current open sheet context to identify empty space.\n
- The formula cell should be near the data it references, so that it is easy to understand the formula in the context of the data. Identify the data being referenced from the Formula and use the nearest unoccupied cell. If multiple data references are being made, choose the one which is most relevant to the Formula.\n
- Unlike code cell placement, Formula cell placement should not use an extra space; formulas should be placed next to the data they reference or next to a label for the calculation.\n
- Pick the location that makes the most sense next to what is being referenced. E.g. formula aggregations often make sense directly underneath or directly beside the data being referenced or next to the label for the calculation.\n
- When doing a calculation on a table column, place the formula directly below the last row of the table.\n

When to use set_formula_cell_value:\n
Set formula cell value tool should be used for relatively simple tasks. Tasks like aggregations, finding means, totals, counting number of instances, etc. You can use this for calculations that reference values in and out of tables. For more complex tasks, use set_code_cell_value.\n
Examples: 
- Finding the mean of a column of numbers
- Counting the number of instances of a value in a column
- Finding the max/min value 
- Basic arithmetic operations 
- Joining strings

This tool converts a selection of cells on a specified sheet into a data table.\n
IMPORTANT: the selection can NOT contain any code cells or data tables.\n
It requires the sheet name, a rectangular selection of cells to convert to a data table, the name of the data table and whether the first row is the column names.\n
A data table cannot be created over any existing code cells or data tables.\n
The table will be created with the first row as the header row if first_row_is_column_names is true, otherwise the first row will be the first row of the data.\n
The data table will include a table name as the first row, which will push down all data by one row.\n
